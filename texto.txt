The Fetch API is a modern JavaScript interface that allows developers to make HTTP requests to servers and handle responses in a cleaner and more flexible way than older methods like XMLHttpRequest.
It is promise-based, making it easier to manage asynchronous operations and chain actions with .then() and .catch() blocks.
A typical usage of fetch involves calling an endpoint, parsing the JSON response, and updating the UI accordingly.
Developers should always check if response.ok is true before trying to parse the body, since a 404 or 500 status does not throw an error automatically.
