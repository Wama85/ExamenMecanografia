The Fetch API is a modern JavaScript interface that allows developers to make HTTP requests to servers and handle responses in a cleaner and more flexible way than older methods like XMLHttpRequest.
It is promise-based, making it easier to manage asynchronous operations and chain actions with .then() and .catch() blocks.
A typical usage of fetch involves calling an endpoint, parsing the JSON response, and updating the UI accordingly.
