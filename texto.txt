Patience is the ability to remain calm and composed in the face of challenges, delays, or difficulties.
It is a virtue that allows one to act wisely, without being driven by impulsiveness or frustration.
Patient people can wait for the right moment, tolerate mistakes, and understand that many things take time.
Developing patience improves human relationships, supports better decision-making, and reduces stress.
Although it is not always easy to cultivate, with practice and self-control it can become a personal strength that helps us grow and face life with balance.
